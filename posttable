"Big Data, corrupted data, missing data – how to handle it all? HDSI co-sponsored a two-day event gathering outstanding researchers pushing the frontiers of statistics as applied to data The need for clarity is imperative as the advent of new technologies creates great opportunities for data-driven discoveries spanning the worlds of science and industry, and impacts both equally The assembled experts addressed such key questions: • How to quantify uncertainty in scientific discoveries? • How to disentangle massive data streams and yet utilize all of the complex data in order to enrich statistical algorithms and models • How to develop efficient algorithms that are robust to the complex nature of the observed data?
