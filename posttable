"Nov 7, 2018, 1-2 pm: A data science expert from Google will be at UC San Diego to give a talk entitled, Surveys and Big Data for Estimating Brand Lift The seminar featuring Tim Hesterberg, senior statistician from Google, is sponsored by The Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics in the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health The event will be held at the School of Medicine campus, in the MET (Medical Education and Telemedicine Building), Lower Auditorium"
" Before his career at Google, Hesterberg worked in academia and the software and utilities industries He earned his PhD in statistics from Stanford University, and wrote Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R; as well as co-authoring the ASA Guidelines for Undergraduate Statistics Programs Now, as he likes to say, he can tell people how to analyze data!"
" Google Brand Lift Surveys estimates the effect of display advertising using surveys Challenges include imperfect A/B experiments, response and solicitation bias, discrepancy between intended and actual treatment, comparing treatment group users who took an action with control users who might have acted, and estimation for different slices of the population We approach these issues using a combination of individual-study analysis and meta-analysis across thousands of studies This work involves a combination of small and large data survey responses and logs data, respectively Learn more at "
